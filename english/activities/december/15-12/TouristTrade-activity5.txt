1. The best films ever were made a long time ago.
It depends. If “long time ago” means about “10-20+” years ago, then yes,
I agree. In my opinion, the actual stories used to be more creative, but on
the other hand, the quality wasn’t so good. Nowadays films are the
opposite for me, the stories aren’t so interesting, they are usually cliche,
however, overall they have a great quality.

2. Social networking websites are a waste of time.
I disagree. I would say that social media at all is sometimes good to give
your mind some time and relax.

3. English is a very easy language to learn.
I agree, however, it requires a lot of practice and interest like any other
language you’d ever like to learn.

I agree; but in the other hand I believe that each time more, people are
showing concern about it.

5. Smoking should be banned in all public places
I disagree, freedom should be a priority.

6. All politicians are the same
Unfortunately I would say that I agree. Broken promises, fake speeches,
are characteristics that they have in common.

when they realize that there are more men than women. Having more
women in positions of power would encourage equality among people
and stimulate others to do the same
